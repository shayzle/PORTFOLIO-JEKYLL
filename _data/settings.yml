# About (Section and Page)

# About Section
blurb: I'm a web development student at Epitech, learning how to build
            clean, functional, and user-focused websites. I'm still growing my
            skills, but I love solving problems, experimenting with new tools,
            and turning ideas into real projects. This portfolio is a place to
            document what I'm learning and what I'm creating along the way.
