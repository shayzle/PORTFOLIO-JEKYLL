I am a web development student at Epitech, originally from Indonesia and currently based in France. My background combines language, communication, and visual design with a growing technical foundation in modern web technologies. This mix allows me to approach digital projects not only from a technical perspective, but also with a strong focus on clarity, usability, and storytelling.

I am particularly interested in building clean, well-structured, and user-centered websites. I enjoy transforming ideas into functional interfaces, experimenting with new tools, and understanding how design and code work together to create meaningful user experiences. Whether it is layout, responsiveness, or interaction, I pay attention to the small details that make a product feel intuitive and professional.

This portfolio represents my learning journey and my practical work as I develop my skills in front-end and full-stack web development. It is a space where I document my projects, test new concepts, and continuously refine my approach as I move toward becoming a professional developer. I am motivated, curious, and committed to growing in this field, and I look forward to contributing my skills to real-world digital projects.
