I'm a web development student at Epitech, learning how to build
clean, functional, and user-focused websites. I'm still growing my
skills, but I love solving problems, experimenting with new tools,
and turning ideas into real projects. This portfolio is a place to
document what I'm learning and what I'm creating along the way.
